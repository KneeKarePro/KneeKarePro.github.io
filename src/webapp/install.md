# Installation
The Web App relies on the following pieces of software to run:
- Node.js
- npm
- React

## NPM
`npm` or Node Package Manager is a package manager for JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command-line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry. By installing NPM we can run all of the necessary libraries from `npm`

To install `npm` on your system, follow the instructions on the [official npm website](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). To install `npm`, it is recommended to use the Node Version Manager (NVM) to manage multiple versions of Node.js and npm. You can install NVM by following the instructions on the [official NVM website](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

Install the latest version of Node.js and npm by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
nvm install node
```
or 
```bash
nvm install --lts
```

## React
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. To install React, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
```
