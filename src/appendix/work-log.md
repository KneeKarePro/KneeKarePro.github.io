| Meet Dr. Alex for the first time                                  | 4:00 PM  | 5:00 PM    | 1 x 4    | This meeting serves as our introduction to Dr. Alex. He was simply looking for a team as he still did not have a description for the project. Sebastian, Nicole, and Daniyal not having group yet… thought to join and check it out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| (02/14/2024)                                                      |
| Meeting Cole for the first time                                   | 11:15 AM | 11:45 AM   | 0.5 x 3  | This meeting serves as the first time Sebastian and Nicole met Cole. This 30 min meeting gave us a chance to meet each other and catch-up Cole on the general idea of what we had planned out for the project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| (02/23/2024)                                                      |
| Design Draft Started and Completed                                | 12:00 PM | 11:39 PM   | 6 x 4    | Soon after we met Cole, we began working on the Design Draft that was due that same day. This mainly composed of us doing research and filling out the requirements for the submission using the rubric given. We each put in a significant amount of time doing research and communicating with one another regarding what we should put in the document. This took us the majority of the day.                                                                                                             |
| (02/23/2024)                                                      |
| Team Meeting #1 with Dr. Alex (02/26/2024)                        | 10:30 AM | 12:15 PM   | 1.75 x 4 | This was the first meeting we had as a full team with Dr. Alex. This served as an introduction to Dr. Alex’s idea, and what we could do to make that idea come to life. We went over our research and our Design Draft Submission with him which allowed us to get a better understanding of what he really wanted for this project. He was very pleased with what we had come up with and we decided to move forward.                                                                                       |
| Order Pieces Needed to Move Forward with the Project              | 12:15 PM | 12:30 PM   | 0.25 x 4 | We had a few min after our official meeting to stay back with Dr. Alex and order the parts necessary at that time. This part was the rotary trinket and the rotary encoder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| (02/26/2024)                                                      |
| Day #1 Working on Design Revision                                 | 10:00 AM | 12:00 PM   | 2 x 4    | This week was particularly busy for the group outside of the project which explains why this was the only meeting we had that week after meeting with Dr. Alex. Here we met up as a team and discussed our approach for the document. We then stayed back for about another hour after the general meeting and did some research that later would prove to be quite useful.                                                                                                                                  |
| (03/01/2024)                                                      |
| Day #2 Working on Design Revision                                 | 12:00 PM | 5:30 PM    | 5.5 x 4  | This phase of the project still mainly required more research. This day allowed us to catch up on some of the time that we had lost in the previous week and mainly served as a day to get the majority of the Design Revision document completed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| (03/04/2024)                                                      |
| Day #3 Working on Design Revision + Peer Evaluation               | 11:30 PM | 3:00 PM    | 3.5 x 4  | Continue reaching on our project and simply fine tune all of the details regarding our approach to the project. We also had to contact Dr. Blanchard due to Dr. Alex not having graded our assignment yet, therefore, we got an extension on the assignment (until 03/10). We also made sure that everyone completed their peer evaluation form.                                                                                                                                                             |
| (03/06/2024)                                                      |
| Day #4 Working on Design Revision                                 | 10:00 AM | 2:00 PM    | 4 x 4    | At this point Dr. Alex has now graded the Design Draft, so we now have the feedback to work from. There was not much feedback and have gotten a very positive review from Dr. Alex as of now, however he did mention that this means. That we can go above and beyond and exceed our original scope now.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| (03/08/2024)                                                      |
| Submitting Design Revision                                        | 9:00 PM  | 11:30 PM   | 2.5 x 4  | We met up later on the submission day to make sure we have all of the pieces needed for the submission. After confirming this using the rubric, we went ahead and submitted to Dr. Alex through email.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| (03/10/2024)                                                      |
| Team Meeting #2 with Dr. Alex                                     | 10:30 AM | 11:30 AM   | 1.5 x 4  | This meeting served as a quick catch up between the team and Dr. Alex. It was one of our shortest, but our most productive meeting by far. Here we updated Dr. Alex on our findings and what we had done up to this point. Mainly the research behind our product and what we could do to make it even better.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| (03/11/2024)                                                      |
| Private Team Meeting (Phone Call)                                 | 9:00 PM  | 10:00 PM   | 1 x 4    | This meeting served as an impromptu call the night of the day we had our meeting with Dr. Alex. We had come to a realization in this meeting that we were very ahead of schedule due to being very effective in the time that we worked. Therefore, we had to begin focusing more on enhancing our idea, rather than maintaining it were we had it. For example, we brought up the idea of using something other than the rotary trinket and different ways of the pico creating its network connection.     |
| (03/11/2024)                                                      |
| Day #1 Working on Pre-Alpha Build                                 | 10:00 AM | 5:00 PM    | 7 x 4    | This day was primarily focused on doing even more research and beginning the coding process. Our primary goals were programming of the rotary trinket, the implementation of the pico creating its own network, and the web app having its base interface running properly. At the end of this day we were able to have both the trinket and the pico somewhat functioning the way they should. This served as a very productive day as the remainder of the week would prove to be much easier due to this. |

| Day #2 Working on Pre-Alpha Build                                 | 9:30 AM  | 2:00 PM    | 4.5 x 4  | This day we decided that it would be best to finalize the trinket and pico and begin focusing on setting up the application to be ready for the Pre-Alpha Build. At the end of this day the trinket was working and reading to a local device and the application was up and running.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Week Break                                                        | N/A      | N/A        | N/A      | We took a week break due to midterms, which we made up by working throughout spring break the week prior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Day #3 Working on Pre-Alpha Build                                 | 10:00 AM | 4:30 PM    | 6.5 x 4  | This day was one of our most productive where we went ahead and got the rotary trinket working exactly as it should, the pico was now able to create its own network and print text through a local host, and the application was now up and running with the use of a password system. We had all elements needed for the Pre-Alpha Build at a base level functionality.                                                                                                                                    |

| Day#4 Working on Pre-Alpha Build + Submission + Peer Evaluation 2 | 10:00 AM | 8:00 PM    | 10 x 4   | We pretty much spent the whole day making sure that we had all of the necessary documentation, GitHub repo, devices working and record the group presentation video. We were very careful and concise with how we wanted everything presented, so we went ahead and spent the whole day making sure it was done perfectly. We also finished out 2<sup>nd</sup> set of peer evaluations.                                                                                                                      |

Classes were getting quite intense for all of us at this point, so it was necessary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Team Meeting #3 with Dr. Alex                                     | 10:30 AM | 11:00 AM   | N/A      | This meeting served as more of a catch up with Dr. Alex. Here he was simply making sure that we were doing alright and asking how our week break went and if we have a plan moving forward. We discussed for about 30 min with him. This was a very brief and quick meeting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Day #1 Working on Prototype                                       | 10:00 AM | 5:00 PM    | 7 x 4    | At this point in time we made a complete 360 in reference to the use of the pico and the rotary trinket. We now decided to use an ESP32 and a potentiometer. As we saw that it had the opportunity of being a much more accurate device if we did so. We spent the whole day researching the specs and how to print a value from the potentiometer to the ESP32, and then began the research process of creating a network from the ESP32 and allowing an external device to connect to it.                  |

| Day #2 Working on Prototype                                       | 11:00 AM | 3:30 PM    | 4.5 x 4  | This day we implemented our research from the previous day and began coding. This led to us being able to print out a value locally from the potentiometer to the ESP32 in voltage measurements, and also create a network for other devices to connect to. This day was extremely fast paced and effective, which allowed us to remain calm in terms of our deadline.                                                                                                                                       |

| Quick Team Meeting                                                | 10:00 PM | 11:00 PM   | 1 x 4    | In this meeting we spoke a bit about what we have done up to this point and what we can do moving forward. Quick general meeting to keep things updated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
